# Stack

Stack is the most specific of the foundations layout components.

It's a component which should be used as container for elements which are placed in a column with a gap between them.

Shorthand for `Flex` component with `flexDirection="column"` and `gap` prop.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Stack } from '@similarweb/ui-components/foundations';

...

<Stack gap="16px">
  {children}
</Stack>
```

<Canvas of={StackStories.StackComponent} />
