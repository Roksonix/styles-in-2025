# Flex

Flex is a more specific layout component that uses the flexbox layout model to align its children.

You can still use the same props as the Box in addition to props which control the flexbox layout.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@similarweb/ui-components/foundations';

...

<Flex>
  {children}
</Flex>
```

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexDefault} />

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@similarweb/ui-components/foundations';

...

<Flex flexDirection="column" gap="16px">
  {children}
</Flex>
```

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexColumn} />

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@similarweb/ui-components/foundations';

...

<Flex alignItems="center" justifyContent="space-between">
  {children}
</Flex>
```

<Canvas of={FlexStories.FlexAlignment} />
